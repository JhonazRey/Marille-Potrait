Lyrics
Oh, you got power, superpowers
Do you even know how to wield them?
All God's children are special
But not like you, no, not like you
You're just like a flower (flower)
You're ever-giving, that's a given
All God's children (all God's children) are special (whoa)
But not like you, no, not like you
Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)
(Lift it, lift it, lift it, lift it)
Mm, it's crazy to say this
But you're the greatest (you are the greatest)
I can't explain it (oh)
I know that you know the truth
They can't deny you, yeah
They can't deny you, it's true

You come a long way, kid
And let me just say this
Oh, yeah, you're the main character now
You're the main character now
Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)

Oh, yeah, you're the main character now
You're the main character now
Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)
Oh, yeah Oh, you got power, superpowers
Do you even know how to wield them?
All God's children are special
But not like you, no, not like you
You're just like a flower (flower)
You're ever-giving, that's a given
All God's children (all God's children) are special (whoa)
But not like you, no, not like you
Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)
(Lift it, lift it, lift it, lift it)
Mm, it's crazy to say this
But you're the greatest (you are the greatest)
I can't explain it (oh)
I know that you know the truth
They can't deny you, yeah
They can't deny you, it's true
Yeah, remember Vegas?
You come a long way, kid
And let me just say this
Oh, yeah, you're the main character now
You're the main character now
Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)
